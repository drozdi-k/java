Firstly I should say that I study at University on the technical faculty. I have started learning programmar three years ago. It was C++ at university. 
Also I learned Java last year. 
I want to learn more in this profession. Programming helps to develop in different areas, such as learning English. 
In the near future, I want to figure out what area I want to work in. And I think these courses will help me.
