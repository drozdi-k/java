I have decided to become a developer, becouse the process of building a program or a code is looks interesting for me.
I'm inspired by the idea that I can create something uniqe. 
This is my first courses I have participated in.
Talking about my plans for the future in this profession, I would like to say "we will see"
But anyway this is what I'm interested in.
And I want to try
So,maybe one day in our world it will be one developer more
