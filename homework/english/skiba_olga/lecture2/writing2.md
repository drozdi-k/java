I have tried to start work in IT since 2014 . 
Then i went to course of QA Automatisation but I did not have enough interest and knowledge of English in this profession. 
At the end of last year i saw an application of javarash, it interested me.
After that i started to look for information related to java programming.
I saw the Javagura course and applied for it.
I hope this course will help me start a career in IT.
